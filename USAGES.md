# Using the program

To launch the program, go to `UMovie/index.html` under WebStorm.

*Make sure that the downloaded file contains the folder UMovie as the root as the projet.
If UMovie is not the root written exactly in this way, it is possible that the front end will not work correctly.*

## Search bar

The search bar allows a search in the page where the user is. For instance, it is possible to make a search for different actors while the user is in the actor page. 

##Searching for actor

If you make a research to find an Actor, there will be actor without picture and/or description. The reason to that is that we are getting those informations from TheMovieDataBase and it doesn't contain every actors from the uMovie API.
