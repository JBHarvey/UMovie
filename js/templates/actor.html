            <p id="text"> William Bradley "Brad" Pitt (born December 18, 1963) is an American
                actor and film producer. Pitt has received two Academy Award nominations
                and four Golden Globe Award nominations, winning one. He has been
                described as one of the world's most attractive men, a label for which
                he has received substantial media attention. Pitt began his acting
                career with television guest appearances, including a role on the
                CBS prime-time soap opera Dallas in 1987. He later gained recognition
                as the cowboy hitchhiker who seduces Geena Davis's character in the
                1991 road movie Thelma & Louise. Pitt's first leading roles in
                big-budget productions came with A River Runs Through It (1992)
                and Interview with the Vampire (1994). He was cast opposite Anthony
                Hopkins in the 1994 drama Legends of the Fall, which earned him his
                first Golden Globe nomination. In 1995 he gave critically acclaimed
                performances in the crime thriller Seven and the science fiction film
                12 Monkeys, the latter securing him a Golden Globe Award for Best
                Supporting Actor and an Academy Award nomination.</p>
