/**
 * Created by Jean-Beno√Æt on 2016-01-18.
 * This file routes the links of the UMovie app
 *
 * The name is routeManager because there seemed to have a problem with
 * the old "router.js" name...
 * The loaded file was empty and it wouldn't work in the browser, as if the one loaded
 * was an old cached version.
