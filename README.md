# UMovie

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/GLO3102/team01.svg?token=z8MuAdp4BiCLDyKa2y46&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/GLO3102/team01)

## About

This project is made in a class context from the GLO-3102 course as Web Application Developpment at the Laval University. The project consists in creating a front-end (client) using an API given by the teachers. The project is mainly based on the client experience optimisation and the importance of the responsiveness. We decided not to use any tool for the CSS so that we could learn more on how to create great things using pure CSS.

## Hosting

Our website is hosted at this [page](http://umovie-team01-h2016.herokuapp.com/UMovie/).

## Custom IMDB API

We made a custom IMDB API to get the informations. The API source code is located at the following [address](https://github.com/AntoineGagne/imdb-api-request).
It is also hosted on Heroku at the following [address](http://imdb-api-request.herokuapp.com).
